      <h2>Income inequality is extreme across all of America.</h2>
      <div id="description">
      <p>Income is the collection of money or revenue earned primarily
         from wages and salaries, but also includes money earned from stocks,
          interest on saving accounts, or collected rent. The disparity between
          the income of the general population and that of the wealthy is incredibly large.
          This wide separation is commonly referred to as Income Inequality. General information
          can be found here, on the home page, but more severly affected populations are
          discussed on the pages linked above. </p>

        <p>The average income of the bottom 90% of Americans is $36,797.
          The top 10% is almost 10 times higher than that, at $338,434; and the
           top 1% averages about 39 times higher, at almost 1.5 million dollars in income. However,
          all of that is nothing in comparison to the average income of the top .1%:
        an insane $7,225,746. over <b> 196 times higher</b> than the bottom 90% of Americans.
      .1% of the American population is just over 300,000 people. 300,000 people make 195 times
      more than 90% of the population, which is <b>295 million</b> Americans.</p>

          <p>Not only do the top 1% of Americans make a ridiculously amount of money,
            their income has been increasing at a much faster rate than the bottom 20%.
            The income of the wealthy has increased around 7 times faster than the bottom 20%,
            even considering periods of economic depression. At its peak, wealthy Americans saw
            a 273% increase in income, where the bottom 20% peaked at a measily 40% increase.</p>
