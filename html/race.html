          <h2>Systemic racism has created a large economic gap between white people and people of color</h2>
          <p>Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) have considerably lower incomes than white people.
          However, the starkest divide among races is that of wealth, which includes savings and owned assets,
          such as houses and shareholdings. Although this website focuses on income inequality, not reporting
          on the racial wealth gap would be omitting crucial information and context. <br><br><br></p>

          <p>Black and Latino families have historically had much higher unemployment rates than white people.
            The pandemic increased unemployment in America, but the resulting impact varied among races. After the economy crashed,
          the unemployment rate increased from 2019 by 2.8% for whites, 5% for Latinos, and 4% for Blacks. So, BIPOC already
            higher rates of unemployment than whites, and then the pandemic layoffs increased the gap further. </p>

          <p>Even when there isn't a global pandemic, BIPOC recieve lower quality healthcare than whites, according to the APM Research Lab.
             This has only been exacerbated by COVID-19. For every 100,000 people within their respective group,
            211 Indigenous people, 155 Black people, and 150 Pacific Islanders have died from the coronavirus.
          White people, of course, have also suffered great losses, but only 121 whites out of every 100,000
          has died from COVID-19. </p>
