    <h2>Women are continuously underrepresented in high-paying jobs.</h2>
    <p>Over the course of history, women have been unable to earn their
       own money and exist independently until recently. In fact, until
       the Equal Credit Act of 1974 <i>(yes, that's right... 1974)</i>, women
       were not allowed to open bank accounts with out their husband or
       male relative's approval. Now, women make up more than half of the United State's
     total workforce. However, women do not earn nearly as much income as men. <br><br><br></p>

      <p>Women make up just 5.4% of Fortune 500 CEOS, and 62.8% of
        minimum wage jobs, despite making up half of the American workforce.
        Men dominate financial industry jobs, in particular. At the top five U.S. investment banks
        (JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, and Citigroup),
         males make up from 69 to 82 percent executives and top managers.</p>

      <p>When the global COVID-19 pandemic hit America, the majority of
        people were economically impacted. However, in March 2020, before the economy shut down,
      unemployment was equal among women and men (4.4%). The unemployment rate due to
      COVID-19 layoffs was <i>significantly</i> higher for women, skyrocketing up to 16.2% in April--
    2.7% higher than the rate of men.</p>
